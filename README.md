Modeling the changes in language in popular american musical works from 1890s to 2010s by decade. This repository serves as a record of a language modeling programing project where I attempted to investigate the change in language in popular american music in the time span of ~ 120 years. Due to the time constraints of learning the software tools I had to use and the time required to refine the project scope there was much room for improvemnet in the way the project was executed from start to finish. The result of the investigation is included in the pdf file report with the abstract and intro provided below:


Abstract:

Music, similar to other artistic works, offers a lens 
into the lives of the artists that produce these 
poetic experiences. Music can also reveal 
important details about a country’s history and the 
experience of everyday people in this country. This 
report details an attempt at using various off the 
shelf NLP tools to analyse the change in language 
in popular American musical works and compare 
that to the greater context of the American 
historical experience between the years of 1890 to 
2019. Due to the nature of the artists that tend to 
populate the mainstream music charts and in
attempt to offer a diverse perspective, I also 
include popular African American artists and rap 
artists that tell unique stories that are less 
glamorised than mainstream pop songs. These 
artists were chosen based on their cultural effect 
on hip hop, soul, R&B or funk and their 
involvement in African American music culture.

Introduction:

When we think of a cultural phenomenon the we 
think of celebrities and popular theatrical works. 
Movies like Titanic and celebrities like Leonardo 
DiCaprio are very influential on modern day pop 
culture. This is no different in the realm of music. 
Nowadays, the most popular and well known 
musical artists globally are (for the most part) 
American. Part of this is because English is the 
most widely spoken language but also because 
American culture has managed to spread to most 
parts of the world and so have the works of 
American artists and celebrities. These artists use 
their music to tell stories that, accompanied by 
enticing instrumentals, are able entertain millions
and create massive followings. It does beg the 
question has popular music stayed the same 
lyrically? Talking lyrically or grammatically one may 
assume that the lyrics have changed just as much 
as how we speak has changed. However, written 
word and spoken word for the most part has not 
changed as much as you’d think. Meaning behind 
some words and the format of sentences may 
have changed. However, the core elements have 
remained the same as I hope to show is the same 
for music. The following sections detail the results 
obtained when analysing the changes in the lyrics
using various off the shelf NLP tools. It is worth 
mentioning that a larger dataset could have been 
compiled for both lists used in the analysis of 
music lyrics in hind sight.
